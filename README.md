# NanoWalletToText
Convert Nano Wallet to UTF8 text and vice-versa

### Demo Online: https://anarkrypto.github.io/NanoWalletToText/

Any character in UTF8 can be represented in base32 in Nano wallet format... it's not just ASCII characters, but a huge range of symbols and characters from different languages.

Doing this we can store any kind of data inside Nano wallets. You can read more about this <a href="https://medium.com/@kaiquenunes/armazenando-dados-em-transa%C3%A7%C3%B5es-nano-14ca2fadeca1" target="_blank"> in this article</a>

Using javascript and html, this web application is completely client-side, running directly in the user's browser, without the need for any central server. This will allow future secure integrations.
